It is considered an Alpha City, in other words, a Global City with strengths in commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment. It is Hungary's financial centre and was ranked as the second fastest-developing urban economy in Europe. Budapest attracts around 12 million international tourists per year, making it a highly popular destination in Europe. The city was chosen as the Best European Destination of 2019, a major poll conducted by EBD, a tourism organisation partnering with the European Commission. It also topped the Best European Destinations 2020 list by Big7Media.\n",

        "Considering the great historical and tourist importance of Budapest and its economic influence, not only over Hungary but over the entire European Union, many investors and entrepreneurs have turned their attention to the region. To achieve the purposes of this project, this report is focused on presenting a study that identifies the best location for opening a food venue in Budapest. More specifically, this study is aimed at stakeholders and investors who wish to open an Ice Cream Shop in the **busiest region of the city**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, a systematic solution to this problem should be presented with the fulfillment of three main requirements:\n",
        "1.   **Finding the busiest district in Budapest:** The interest of investors and stakeholders in identifying such location is justified considering that a busy spot brings greater movement and circulation to an establishment, therefore increases its chance of success, due brand awareness and a potential increase in clientele.\n",
        "2.   **Finding the direct competitors in the area of the busiest district**: The goal of this requirement is to find the regions within the busiest district that are already saturated with direct competitors. This new Ice Cream Shop should be open in an area with a minimum possible competition. For this analysis, a \"direct competitor\" is defined as another venue that is specialized in ice cream.\n",
        "3.   **Finding a cluster of food venues that are not direct competitors**: Most cities have regions with clusters of restaurants, bars, and pubs. These clusters are an optimal location for this Ice Cream Shop, considering that after a proper meal, people tend to look forward to a great dessert."
