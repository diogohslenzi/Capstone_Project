It is considered an Alpha City, in other words, a Global City with strengths in commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment. It is Hungary's financial centre and was ranked as the second fastest-developing urban economy in Europe.Budapest attracts around 12 million international tourists per year, making it a highly popular destination in Europe. The city was chosen as the Best European Destination of 2019, a major poll conducted by EBD, a tourism organisation partnering with the European Commission.

To achieve the purposes of this project, this report is focused on presenting a study that identifies the best location for opening a restaurant in Budapest. More specifically, this report is aimed at stakeholders and investors who wish to open a Burger Joint in the busiest region of the city.\n",

Budapest is divided into twenty-three neighborhoods, so it is necessary to first identify the neighborhood with the highest population density. After that, the analysis of the ideal location for a new Burger Joint will be based on the existence of direct and indirect competitions, these being other burger joints and other establishments that provide food, respectively."
