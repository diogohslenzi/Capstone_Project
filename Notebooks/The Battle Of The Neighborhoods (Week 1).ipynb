    "This project serves the purpose to find an optimal location for a restaurant in New Zealand. More specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening a **Brazilian restaurant** in **Auckland**, the most populous city in the country, also the hosting location for almost than half of the Brazilian migrants, according to the local Census Report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that Auckland is already a very saturated city, with a great diversity of restaurants, this report will focus on three basic criteria:\n",
    "1. It will show **locations that are not already crowded with restaurants**.\n",
    "2. It will prioritize  **areas with no Brazilian restaurants in vicinity**.\n",
    "3. Assuming that the above-mentioned conditions are met, the report will also preference locations **as close to the city center as possible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science tools will be used to apoint the most promissing neighborhoods based on these criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."
